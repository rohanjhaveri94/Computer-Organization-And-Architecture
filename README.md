*******************************************************************************************************************************************

This course on Computer Organization and Architecture (ECE 452) is taught by Dr. Sudeep Pasricha at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. .It talks about how a computer is organized. Basically it talks about processor pipelining and performance. The course also discusses abou RISC and CISC architectures and discuss MIPS assembly language which is used in RISC architecture. 
The course also teaches about branch predictions and different typyes of branch predictors and how it can optimize the performance of a computer.
It also focuses on memory hierarchy and its impact on the computer's performance and talks in depth about the cache architecture and its benefits.
This repository contains all the assignments which I did in this course which are described briefly before:

•Assignment 1 talks about the performance of a CPU under different processor parameter. Its shows how instruction level parallelism i.e. pipelining can improve the performance of the processor.

•Assignment 2 & 3 is about MIPS assembly language based on RISC architecture and its implementation.

•Assignment 4 is about branch prediction and comparison of different branch predictors and their performance.

•Assignment 5 & 6 is based on cache architecture. In this I analyzed the performance improvement of the cache in assignment 5 and in assignment 6, I used a sniper tool from Splash-2 benchmark to analyze cache performance and compared it with the theoretical calculation in assignment 5.
